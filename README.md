# CopyCat

**Easily bundle files for LLM context windows**

CopyCat is a VS Code extension that helps you share code with large language models (LLMs) by packaging selected files into a single, well-formatted text block. Perfect for when you need to provide context to AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Visual File Selection**: Browse and select files through an intuitive tree view in the Explorer
- **Token Estimation**: See approximate token counts for each file to manage context window limits
- **Smart Ignoring**: Automatically respects `.gitignore` rules to exclude unnecessary files
- **Multiple Copy Modes**:
  - Copy files with basic formatting
  - Copy files with a custom prompt for better LLM context
- **Language Detection**: Automatic syntax highlighting for 20+ programming languages
- **Real-time Updates**: File tree updates automatically as you modify your codebase

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install the Extension**: Search for "CopyCat" in the VS Code Extensions marketplace and install it
2. **Open Your Project**: Open a folder/workspace in VS Code
3. **Access CopyCat**: Look for the "CopyCat" section in the Explorer panel (usually on the left)
4. **Select Files**: Check the files or folders you want to include in your LLM conversation
5. **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the clipboard icon or use the command palette to copy your selection
6. **Paste in LLM**: Paste the formatted output into your AI assistant

## üìã How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. In the **CopyCat** view (in the Explorer panel), you'll see your project's file structure
2. Check the boxes next to files or folders you want to include
3. The total token count is shown at the top of the view
4. Click the clipboard icon üìã to copy all selected files to your clipboard
5. Paste the result into your LLM conversation

### Advanced Usage with Prompts

1. Select your files as usual
2. Click the comment icon üí¨ (or use Command Palette ‚Üí "CopyCat: Copy Selected Files to Clipboard with Prompt")
3. Enter a description of what you want the LLM to help you with
4. The extension will format your request along with the selected files
5. Copy and paste into your LLM

### Command Palette Commands

- `CopyCat: Copy Selected Files to Clipboard` - Basic copy with file contents
- `CopyCat: Copy Selected Files to Clipboard with Prompt` - Copy with custom prompt
- `Debug CopyCat Settings` - View current settings and statistics

## üìÑ Output Format

When you copy files, they're formatted as clean markdown with:

1. **Codebase Overview** - Brief introduction for the LLM
2. **File Structure** - Complete project tree (excluding ignored files)
3. **Selected Files** - Full contents of your chosen files with proper syntax highlighting

Example output:

```markdown
# Codebase Overview

This is a codebase with the following structure. The selected files are provided below with their full contents.

## File Structure
```

Copycat/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClipboardHandler.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json

````

## Selected Files

### src/extension.ts

```typescript
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // Your code here
}
````

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Configure CopyCat in VS Code settings:

- **Show Ignored Nodes**: When enabled, files matching `.gitignore` patterns appear greyed out but unselectable. When disabled (default), they're completely hidden.
- **System Prompt**: Add a custom system prompt that gets prepended to every "Copy with Prompt" request.

## üéØ Supported Languages

CopyCat automatically detects and applies syntax highlighting for:
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C/C++
- Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala
- Shell scripts, SQL, JSON, YAML, XML
- Markdown, HTML, CSS, and many more

## üîß Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher
- A workspace/folder opened in VS Code

## üí° Tips

- **Token Management**: Keep an eye on the token count to stay within your LLM's context window limits
- **Selective Sharing**: Only include relevant files to get more focused AI responses
- **Use Prompts**: The "Copy with Prompt" feature helps LLMs understand what you're trying to accomplish
- **Ignore Files**: The extension automatically respects `.gitignore`, but you can also create a `.contextignore` file for additional exclusions
